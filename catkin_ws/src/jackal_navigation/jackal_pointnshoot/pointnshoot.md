# Overview of Provided Python Scripts

This document summarizes the purpose of each Python script and highlights what can be modified to fix errors or adapt the script for specific use cases.

## 1. `rviz_goal_publisher.py`
### **Purpose:**
- Listens to goals set in RViz (`/move_base_simple/goal`) and broadcasts the goal as a transform (`goal` frame in `map` frame).

### **Potential Modifications:**
- Ensure the topic name `/move_base_simple/goal` matches the one configured in RViz.
- Adjust the frame IDs (`map` and `goal`) if different coordinate frames are used in your setup.
- Add error handling for when RViz does not send a goal.

## 2. `mock_movebase_combined.py`
### **Purpose:**
- Acts as a navigation controller for moving the robot from its current position to a goal using velocity commands.
- Computes the vector between the robot and the goal and publishes velocity commands to `/cmd_vel`.

### **Potential Modifications:**
- Verify the topic names (e.g., `/cmd_vel`) and frame IDs (`base_link`, `goal`) to match the Jackal's configuration.
- Adjust the velocity parameters (`linear.x`, `angular.z`) to ensure the robot moves within safe limits.
- Add collision avoidance or obstacle detection logic if needed.

---

## 3. `mock_jackal.py`
### **Purpose:**
- Simulates the robot's motion based on velocity commands (`/cmd_vel`).
- Updates the robot's pose and broadcasts transforms (`base_link` relative to `odom`).

### **Potential Modifications:**
- Ensure the robot's initial pose and velocity parameters align with the simulation requirements.
- Adjust the frequency (`rate`) to match the robot's real-world performance.
- Add more complex motion models or sensor simulation if required.

## 4. `waypoint_creator.py`
### **Purpose:**
- Saves waypoints based on the robot's current position relative to the `map` frame.
- Allows interactive saving of waypoints.

### **Potential Modifications:**
- Ensure the frame IDs (`map`, `base_link`) match the Jackal's setup.
- Add functionality to save waypoints to a file or database for reuse.
- Implement error handling for failed transform lookups.

## General Notes:
- **Frame IDs**: Ensure all scripts use the correct coordinate frames (`map`, `odom`, `base_link`, etc.) as per your robot's configuration.
- **Topic Names**: Double-check all topic names (`/cmd_vel`, `/move_base_simple/goal`, etc.) to ensure compatibility with your ROS setup.
- **Error Handling**: Add robust error handling, especially for missing transforms or messages.
- **Testing**: Test each script in isolation to verify functionality before integrating into the full navigation stack.
